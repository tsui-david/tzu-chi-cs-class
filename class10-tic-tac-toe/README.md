# Tic Tac Toe Game
This will be a mini project on creating the tic tac toe game.


## Cheat Sheet
Initializing (creating) a new array
```
a = []
```

Adding new element to the array
```
a = []
a.append(1)
print(a) # a = [1]
```


Accessing an element in the array
```
a = [1,2,3,4]
print(a[2]) # prints 3
```


Doing a for loop through an array and printing all the elements:
```
a = [1,2,3,4]
for i in range(len(a)):
    print(a[i])
```

Control flow:
```
num = 3

if num < 0:
    print('number is less than 0')
elif num == 0:
    print('number is equal to 0')
else:
    print('number is greather than 0')
```
